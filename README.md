# Connect Four Project Base

<img src="https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ConnectFour_CASComSci_2019-2020/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true" width="40%" align="right">

This repo contains the code for a very basic Connect Four app. At present, it lacks a lot of functionality and looks very basic.

There are several ways to improve upon this app listed under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ConnectFour_CASComSci_2019-2020/issues). Other possible improvements can also be suggested.

It is the job of the student to read through the code in this project and improve upon it to make it a more fully functioning Connect Four game.

Work should not be done on (a cloned copy of) this repo directly. Instead, this repo should be [forked](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), and changes should be made in the forked repo. Pull requests can then be opened back into this repo's master branch. The issue(s) that the PR addresses should be included in the PR as well.
