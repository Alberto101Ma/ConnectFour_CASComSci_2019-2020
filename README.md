# Connect Four Project Base

<img src="https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ConnectFour_CASComSci_2019-2020/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true" width="40%" align="right">

This repo contains the code for a very basic Connect Four app. At present, it lacks a lot of functionality and looks very basic.

There are several ways to improve upon this app listed under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/ConnectFour_CASComSci_2019-2020/issues). Other possible improvements can also be suggested.

It is the job of the student to read through the code in this project and improve upon it to make it a more fully functioning Connect Four game.
